🧠 Day-1 — Interview Q&A (With Real-Time Style Answers)
🔹 SQL
1️⃣ Difference: INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN

👉 Real-time Answer

INNER JOIN returns only the matching records between both tables.
LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and the matching ones from the right — if no match, NULLs are returned.
In projects, we mostly use LEFT JOIN when left table is our primary entity like customers, and still require full visibility even if related data is missing.

2️⃣ What are Window Functions?

👉 Real-time Answer

Window functions allow row-level calculations without collapsing rows like GROUP BY.
I use them mainly for ranking employees by salary, running totals, and time-based analytics in data pipelines (e.g., ordering transactions within a user partition).

3️⃣ Query: 2nd Highest Salary
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);


👉 Real-time Explanation to Add

This avoids issues with duplicates and returns the true 2nd highest value by excluding the maximum salary dynamically.

🔹 Data Engineering (Real-Time Concepts)
Data Lake vs Data Warehouse (Professional Answer)
Feature	Data Lake	Data Warehouse
Data Type	Raw (Structured + Semi-structured + Unstructured)	Processed & Structured
Schema	Schema-on-read	Schema-on-write
Storage Cost	Low (e.g., S3)	High
Users	Data Scientists, ML, Engineers	BI Users, Business Teams
Use-Case	Exploration, ML Training	Reporting & Analytics

👉 Real-time Answer Add-on

In my pipelines, I ingest data first into Data Lake (Bronze → Silver → Gold zones) and then push curated data into Data Warehouse for analytics.

🔹 Apache Spark
Transformation vs Action
Transformation	Action
Lazy execution	Trigger execution
Returns new DF	Returns value/ writes output
Examples: filter(), select()	Examples: show(), count(), write()

👉 Real-time Add-on

We design pipelines with more transformations and only 1-2 actions at the end to optimize jobs under the DAG execution model.

🔹 AWS Cloud
How do you orchestrate a Data Pipeline in AWS?

👉 Real-time Answer

I generally orchestrate ETL pipelines using AWS Step Functions + Glue + Lambda.
Data flows like:
S3 (raw) → Glue (PySpark transformations) → S3/Redshift (curated)
Error handling with Step Functions retry policies and EventBridge alerts.

🔹 Scenario-Based (Most Important!)
❌ Pipeline failed due to missing columns — What will you do?

👉 Real-time Excellent Answer

I always implement schema validation before processing.
If columns are missing:

Extract schema from Glue Catalog / metadata store

Validate input schema using PySpark / JSON rules

Redirect bad records to a quarantine S3 folder

Log exceptions in CloudWatch + notify via SNS/Slack

Fix upstream or enable default column handling for optional fields

This ensures pipeline reliability without compromising data quality.

📌 What You Should Say at End of Any Answer

You can add:

“Based on best practices from my recent projects…”
“This approach avoids reprocessing cost and ensures data quality.”

This makes your answer sound real-time and professional. 💼✨
