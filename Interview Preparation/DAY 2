# 📝 Day-2 — SQL + Data Engineering Interview Q&A

### **Q1️⃣: What is Data Normalization? Why do we use it?**

**Answer:**

> "Normalization is the process of organizing data into tables to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
> In transactional systems, normalized tables make updates faster and consistent."

---

### **Q2️⃣: What is Denormalization? Where is it used?**

**Answer:**

> "Denormalization is merging tables to reduce joins and improve query performance.
> It is mainly used in Data Warehousing for fast analytical queries."

---

### **Q3️⃣: What is Star Schema? Why is it preferred?**

**Answer:**

> "A Star Schema has one Fact table linked with multiple Dimension tables.
> It is preferred for reporting because it is easy to understand, supports fast aggregations, and improves query performance."

### **Q4️⃣: Difference between Fact Table and Dimension Table?**

| Feature | Fact Table             | Dimension Table       |
| ------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Content | Measures, numeric data | Descriptive details   |
| Growth  | Very large             | Smaller               |
| Keys    | Contains foreign keys  | Contains primary keys |

**Short Answer:**

> "Facts = numbers we measure
> Dimensions = business context for those numbers"

### **Q5️⃣: What is OLTP vs OLAP?**

| OLTP                          | OLAP                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Online Transaction Processing | Online Analytical Processing |
| Small, frequent transactions  | Large, analytical queries    |
| Normalized schema             | Star/Snowflake schema        |
| Example: Banking app          | Example: BI dashboards       |

---

### **Q6️⃣: What are Window Functions? Why used?**

**Answer:**

> "Window functions perform calculations like ranking or running totals **without** grouping or losing detail.
> Used in analytics like top-N products, trend analysis, customer segmentation."

Example:

```sql
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC)
```

### **Q7️⃣: What is ETL vs ELT?**

| ETL                      | ELT                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Transform before loading | Transform after loading                |
| Used in on-prem DW       | Used in cloud DW (Snowflake, BigQuery) |

**Short Answer:**

> "ETL = Transform then Load
> ELT = Load then Transform (Cloud Data Engineering approach)"

---

### **Q8️⃣: What is a Primary Key and Foreign Key?**

**Answer:**

> "Primary Key uniquely identifies a row in a table.
> Foreign Key connects two tables and enforces relationship integrity."

---

### **Q9️⃣: What is Data Lake vs Data Warehouse?**

| Data Lake               | Data Warehouse               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Raw & unstructured data | Processed & structured data  |
| Low-cost storage        | High performance storage     |
| Example: AWS S3         | Example: Snowflake, Redshift |

---

### **Q🔟: What does GROUP BY do?**

**Short Answer:**

> "GROUP BY groups data based on columns and performs aggregations like SUM, AVG, COUNT for each group."
